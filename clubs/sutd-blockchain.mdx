# About

SEVEN Blockchain Club is the focused student organization for blockchain innovation at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD). As the university expands its curriculum to include courses like "Blockchain Systems & Applications" covering distributed consensus and smart contracts [sutd.edu.sg](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/course/51-510-blockchain-systems-applications/), SEVEN serves as the primary hub for extracurricular development and networking. The club aims to bridge the gap between academic theory and the practical Web3 ecosystem, fostering a community of developers and researchers in Singapore.
