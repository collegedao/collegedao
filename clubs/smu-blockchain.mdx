# About

Founded in 2018, SMU Blockchain Club is a student-run organization at Singapore Management University dedicated to fostering blockchain innovation through education, research, and consulting. The club aims to equip students with knowledge of upcoming trends and potential applications relevant to their future careers, bridging the gap between SMU and blockchain technology organizations. They offer opportunities through a Blockchain Developer Department for hands-on coding and a Research Department for investment analysis. [smublockchainclub.com](https://www.smublockchainclub.com/)
