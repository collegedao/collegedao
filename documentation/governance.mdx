# Governance Overview

College DAO operates through a council-based governance model designed for university blockchain communities.

## Council Model

### Structure
- **One seat per verified university club**
- **No governance token**
- **Equal voting power for all council members**
- **Transparent on-chain execution via Realms**
- **Manual verification by CollegeDAO core team**

### Club Status

Clubs are classified as either **Active** or **Dormant**:

| Status | Definition | Voting Rights |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| **Active** | Verified by CollegeDAO, holds council role, participates in governance | Full voting rights |
| **Dormant** | Has not participated in voting for 2+ consecutive quarters | None |

**Dormancy = Loss of Voting Rights**: When a club becomes dormant, they lose their voting rights on the council. To rejoin, they must go through the full admission process again—securing a sponsor and passing a council vote. This ensures only actively participating clubs retain governance power.

### Admission Requirements

New clubs and returning dormant clubs can join the council by:
1. Having an active blockchain club at an accredited university
2. [Registering through our onboarding form](https://tally.so/r/lbeyGp)
3. Securing sponsorship from an existing council member
4. Passing a council admission vote (66% supermajority)
5. Receiving council member role from CollegeDAO core team

<Note>
**Returning Clubs**: Previously dormant clubs must complete the same admission process. There is no automatic reinstatement—existing council members vote on all admissions equally.
</Note>

## Proposal Types

- **Funding Requests**: Events, hackathons, travel sponsorships, and other budget requests
- **New Club Admissions**: Adding new university clubs to the council
- **Policy & Treasury Changes**: Governance and treasury updates

All proposals require supermajority (66%) approval from council members.

## Voting Process

### Proposal Lifecycle

1. **Submission**
   - Submit your proposal through our form
   - Minimum 3 days for community review

2. **Review Phase**
   - CollegeDAO core team reviews for completeness
   - Council reviewers check alignment with treasury guidelines
   - Feedback provided before on-chain vote

3. **Voting Phase** (Realms)
   - On-chain proposal created with final terms
   - Voting period: 5 days
   - All active council members encouraged to vote

4. **Execution Phase**
   - Approved proposals execute on-chain
   - Funds transferred to club wallet
   - Document outcomes and impact

### Quorum Requirements

Quorum scales dynamically based on the number of active clubs to maintain governance efficiency as the network grows:

| Active Clubs | Quorum Threshold | Example |
|--------------|------------------|---------|
| 1-15 | 40% | 6 of 15 clubs |
| 16-30 | 33% | 10 of 30 clubs |
| 31-50 | 25% | 12 of 50 clubs |
| 51+ | 20% | 12 of 60 clubs |

- **Quorum**: The percentage of active clubs (per table above) that must cast a vote (Yes, No, or Abstain)
- **Approval**: 66% supermajority of votes cast must approve
- **Active Count**: Determined at proposal creation time based on current active club roster

If quorum is not met, the proposal may be extended or resubmitted.

### Voting Rights

- Each verified club holds one vote
- Votes are non-transferable
- Only active clubs may vote

## How to Vote

1. Visit [Realms](https://realms.today) and find College DAO
2. Connect your council wallet (the wallet that holds your council role)
3. Review the proposal details
4. Cast your vote: Yes, No, or Abstain
5. Add a comment explaining your reasoning (encouraged)

## Seasonal Schedule

College DAO operates on a quarterly/academic calendar:

- **Winter (Q1)** (Jan - Mar): Major events, annual planning and treasury review
- **Spring (Q2)** (Apr - Jun): Focus on hackathons, internships and founder residencies
- **Summer (Q3)** (Jul - Sep): Conference sponsorships and internships
- **Fall (Q4)** (Oct - Dec): New club onboarding and major events

## Proposal Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Include clear deliverables and success metrics
2. **Show Impact**: Explain how this benefits the broader community
3. **Budget Wisely**: Provide detailed cost breakdowns
4. **Set Milestones**: Define checkpoints for multi-phase projects

## Council Responsibilities

Members are expected to:
- Review and vote on proposals regularly
- Participate in at least one vote per quarter to maintain active status
- Sponsor and mentor new clubs
- Maintain active club operations at their university
- Participate in governance discussions

## Conflict of Interest

Council members should disclose conflicts when:
- They share leadership with another council club
- They have a direct financial interest in a proposal outcome
- A proposal directly benefits their club

Members with conflicts should either abstain or provide a public explanation of their vote.

## Dispute Resolution

Conflicts are resolved through:
1. Community discussion
2. Mediation by volunteer council members
3. Formal vote if consensus cannot be reached
4. Appeals process for significant disputes

## Amendments

This governance document can be updated through the policy proposal process. All changes require supermajority approval and a 7-day discussion period.
