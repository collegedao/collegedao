# Get Started with College DAO

Welcome to College DAO! This guide will walk you through everything you need to join the Ecosystem Fund and receive funding for your university blockchain initiatives.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:

1. **A Solana Wallet**
   - We recommend [Phantom](https://phantom.app/), [Solflare](https://solflare.com/), or [Backpack](https://backpack.app/)
   - For multi-sig club treasuries, use [Squads](https://squads.xyz/) - contact us for a free SquadsX account
   - Fund it with at least ~0.1 SOL for transaction fees
   - Keep your seed phrase(s) secure!

2. **Active University Blockchain Club**
   - Must be affiliated with an accredited university
   - Have regular meetings and activities

## Step 1: Register Your Club

Getting started is simple - just fill out our onboarding form:

> **🚀 Register Your Club**
> 
> Submit your club information to join the Ecosystem Fund
> 
> [Register here](https://tally.so/r/lbeyGp)

**[→ Register Your Club](https://tally.so/r/lbeyGp)**

You'll need to provide:
- Club name and university
- Your region
- Club wallet address (Solana required)
- Contact information
- Brief description of your club

Once submitted, our team will review your application. You'll then need a sponsor and council vote to join (see Step 2).

## Step 2: Get Sponsored

New clubs need an existing council member to back their application. This ensures quality and helps with onboarding.

### Finding a Sponsor

1. **Browse existing clubs**: Check our [Clubs Leaderboard](/clubs) to find clubs in your region
2. **Reach out**: Join our Telegram community and introduce yourself
3. **Build relationships**: Great way to meet and partner with other members

After a sponsor agrees to back you, they will raise an on-chain proposal on Realms to add your club to the governance program.

## Step 3: Submit Funding Proposals

Once you're part of the council, you can request funding from the Ecosystem Fund for your initiatives - hackathons, conferences, travel sponsorships, workshops, and more.

> **📄 Submit a Proposal**
> 
> Request funding for your next event or initiative
> 
> [Submit here]([PROPOSAL_FORM_LINK])

**[→ Submit a Proposal]([PROPOSAL_FORM_LINK])**

### What Happens Next

1. **Community Review**: Council members review your proposal (minimum 3 days)
2. **On-Chain Vote**: Your proposal goes to vote on Realms (5-day voting period)
3. **Funding**: If approved (66% supermajority), funds are sent to your club wallet

## Step 4: Execute Your Event

After your proposal passes and you receive funding:

- Execute according to your proposal
- Document with photos and metrics
- Track all expenses carefully
- Share results with the community

## Step 5: Support the Ecosystem (Optional)

Help grow the Ecosystem Fund by connecting donors to CollegeDAO:

- **Purpose-Restricted Donations**: Direct donors to contribute to the Ecosystem Fund with specific purposes (e.g., "travel sponsorships", "hackathon funding"). When your club submits a proposal matching that purpose, it can be funded from the restricted pool.
- **Direct Club Support**: Donors wanting to support your club directly can send to your club's wallet (shown on your profile).

See the [Treasury Guide](./treasury) for full details on donation options.

## Step 6: Participate in Governance

As a council member, you have voting rights and responsibilities:

> ⚠️ **Warning**: **Stay Active**: Clubs that don't vote for 2+ consecutive quarters become **dormant** and are removed from the Ecosystem Fund. To rejoin, you must go through the full admission process again (sponsor + council vote).

### Voting on Proposals

1. **Review regularly**: Check new proposals weekly
2. **Vote on-chain**: Yes, No, or Abstain via [Realms](https://realms.today)
3. **Be timely**: Don't miss the 5-day voting window

### Types of Votes

- **Admission**: New clubs joining
- **Budget**: Funding requests for events
- **Policy**: Governance changes
- **Treasury**: Multi-sig updates

## Common Questions

### How much SOL do I need?

- **For transactions**: ~0.01-0.1 SOL covers most operations
- **For council membership**: No SOL required, you'll receive a council NFT

### What if our proposal is rejected?

- **Get feedback**: Ask voters for their reasoning
- **Revise and resubmit**: Most proposals pass after revision
- **Start smaller**: Try a smaller budget first to build trust

### Can we change our club wallet?

Yes, contact us to update your wallet address.

## Best Practices

### For New Clubs

✅ **Start small**: First proposal under $1,000
✅ **Document everything**: Photos, receipts, attendee counts
✅ **Engage actively**: Join Discord, attend calls
✅ **Help others**: Sponsor new clubs once established
✅ **Connect donors**: Help donors discover CollegeDAO and purpose-restricted giving

### For Proposals

✅ **Be specific**: Clear budgets and timelines
✅ **Show impact**: How many students will benefit?
✅ **Plan ahead**: Submit 2+ weeks before your event
✅ **Follow up**: Share results after execution
