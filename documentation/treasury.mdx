# Treasury Guide

This guide covers College DAO treasury management, the Ecosystem Fund, and donation options.

## Ecosystem Fund

The **Ecosystem Fund** is College DAO's primary treasury, managed on [Realms](https://realms.today). It serves as the central pool for:

- **Funding student initiatives**: Hackathons, conferences, workshops, and travel sponsorships
- **Supporting new clubs**: Seed funding for emerging university blockchain communities
- **Sustaining operations**: Infrastructure, tooling, and community resources

### How It Works

1. **Proposals request funds**: Clubs submit funding proposals for initiatives
2. **Council votes**: Members vote on-chain via Realms
3. **Funds disbursed**: Approved proposals receive USDC/SOL from the Ecosystem Fund
4. **Voluntary donations**: Clubs, individuals, and organizations can donate to sustain the fund

### Fund Transparency

All Ecosystem Fund transactions are publicly visible on-chain through Realms. Monthly snapshots and quarterly reports are published for full transparency.

## Donation Options

College DAO offers three pathways for donors to support the university blockchain ecosystem:

### 1. General Fund Donations

Unrestricted donations that go directly to the Ecosystem Fund treasury. These funds can be used for any council-approved purpose, providing maximum flexibility for the DAO to allocate resources where they're needed most.

**Example:**
```
Donation: $1,000 USDC
Type: General Fund

Result: Funds added to Ecosystem Fund, available for any approved proposal
```

### 2. Purpose-Restricted Donations

Donors can specify exactly how their donation should be used. This creates a restricted pool that can only fund proposals matching the donor's specified purpose.

**Example - Travel Sponsorships:**
```
Donation: $100,000 USDC
Type: Purpose-Restricted
Restriction: Travel sponsorships for conference attendance

Result: Creates a restricted pool; only travel sponsorship proposals can access these funds
```

**Example - Regional Focus:**
```
Donation: $5,000 USDC
Type: Purpose-Restricted
Restriction: Clubs in Asian and African regions

Result: Creates a regional pool; only proposals from Asian/African clubs can access these funds
```

### 3. Direct Club Support

Donors who want to support a specific club can donate directly to that club's wallet address (displayed on each club's profile page). These donations are not managed by the Ecosystem Fund—they go directly to the club.

**Example:**
```
Donation: $500 USDC
Type: Direct Club Support
Recipient: Berkeley Blockchain Club wallet (shown on their profile)

Result: Funds sent directly to club, no Ecosystem Fund involvement
```

## Purpose-Restricted Pools

When a donor makes a purpose-restricted donation, the funds are held in a designated pool within the Ecosystem Fund.

### Pool Categories

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Activity-Based** | Hackathons, conferences, travel sponsorships, workshops |
| **Regional** | Asian clubs, African clubs, European clubs, Latin American clubs |
| **Stage-Based** | New club grants, established club programs |
| **Custom** | Any specific purpose defined by the donor |

### Pool Tracking

Each restricted pool is tracked separately with:
- Total funds available
- Funds allocated to approved proposals
- Funds disbursed
- Remaining balance

## How Proposals Access Restricted Pools

Clubs do not need to do anything special to access restricted pools. The process is simple:

1. **Club submits a proposal** through the normal proposal process
2. **Council reviews the proposal** and identifies eligible funding sources
3. **Council matches proposals to pools** based on the proposal's purpose and the pool's restrictions
4. **Proposal funded** from the appropriate pool(s)

**Example:**
```
Proposal: Stanford Blockchain requests $2,000 for travel to ETHDenver
Eligible Pool: "Travel Sponsorships" restricted pool ($100,000 available)

Council Action: Approves proposal and allocates $2,000 from the Travel Sponsorships pool
```

## Unused Funds Policy

Purpose-restricted donations that remain unused for **24 months** may be reallocated:

1. **Related purposes first**: Funds may be redirected to similar activities or regions
2. **General Fund fallback**: If no related purpose exists, funds may be moved to the General Fund

Before reallocation, College DAO will:
- Attempt to contact the original donor
- Publish the proposed reallocation for community review
- Document the reallocation in transparency reports
