# Treasury Guide

This guide covers College DAO treasury management, the Ecosystem Fund, and how to make voluntary donations.

## Ecosystem Fund

The **Ecosystem Fund** is College DAO's primary treasury, managed on [Realms](https://realms.today). It serves as the central pool for:

- **Funding student initiatives**: Hackathons, conferences, workshops, and travel sponsorships
- **Supporting new clubs**: Seed funding for emerging university blockchain communities
- **Sustaining operations**: Infrastructure, tooling, and community resources
- **Matching Pool**: Funds reserved to match donations sourced by clubs

### How It Works

1. **Proposals request funds**: Clubs submit funding proposals for initiatives
2. **Council votes**: Members vote on-chain via Realms
3. **Funds disbursed**: Approved proposals receive USDC/SOL from the Ecosystem Fund
4. **Voluntary donations**: Clubs, individuals, and organizations can donate to sustain the fund

### Fund Transparency

All Ecosystem Fund transactions are publicly visible on-chain through Realms. Monthly snapshots and quarterly reports are published for full transparency.

## Voluntary Donations

### Supporting the Ecosystem

Donations to the Ecosystem Fund are entirely voluntary. Any club, individual, or organization can donate to help support student builders across universities. There are no minimum requirements or verification needed.

### Recognition

All donors are recognized on our public leaderboards:
- **Clubs**: Donations attributed to your club profile
- **Individuals**: Personal recognition on the donors leaderboard
- **Organizations**: Sponsor recognition on the organizations leaderboard

### Why Donate?

- **Sustainability**: Helps fund future student initiatives
- **Community**: Supports the broader university blockchain ecosystem
- **Recognition**: Public acknowledgment on leaderboards
- **Impact**: Your donation directly helps other university clubs
- **Matching**: Donations credited to a club may unlock matching funds

## Matching Donations Program

College DAO operates a **Matching Donations Program** to incentivize clubs to source external donations. This works similarly to how universities manage endowment donations with designated purposes.

### How Matching Works

When a donor makes a donation and credits it to a specific club, College DAO may match that donation from the Matching Pool, amplifying the club's impact.

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Match Ratio** | Up to 1:1 (dollar-for-dollar) |
| **Per-Club Cap** | Maximum $3,000 USDC matched per club per quarter |
| **Matching Pool** | 20-30% of quarterly Ecosystem Fund budget reserved for matching |
| **Activation** | Matching only active when pool has sufficient funds |

### Donation Designation Types

Similar to university endowments, donors can designate their donation for specific purposes:

| Designation | Description | Matching Eligible |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **General Fund** | Unrestricted, supports any Ecosystem Fund purpose | No |
| **Club Credit** | Credited to a specific club that sourced the donation | Yes |
| **Regional Fund** | Supports clubs in a specific region (e.g., Asia, Europe) | No |
| **Purpose-Restricted** | Earmarked for specific use (e.g., hackathons only) | No |

### How to Source Matching-Eligible Donations

1. **Find a donor**: Individual, company, or organization willing to support CollegeDAO
2. **Direct them to donate**: They send funds to the Ecosystem Fund wallet
3. **Record with club credit**: When recording the donation, the donor specifies your club as the referrer
4. **Matching applied**: CollegeDAO core team calculates and credits matching funds quarterly

### Matching Calculation

At the end of each quarter, CollegeDAO core team:

1. Reviews all donations with club credits
2. Calculates matching amounts (1:1 up to cap)
3. Publishes a **Quarterly Matching Report**
4. Credits matching amounts to clubs for their next funding proposals

**Example**:
```
Club: Berkeley Blockchain
Donations sourced this quarter:
  - Alumni donation: $500 USDC (credited to Berkeley Blockchain)
  - Company sponsorship: $2,000 USDC (credited to Berkeley Blockchain)
  
Total sourced: $2,500 USDC
Match (1:1, up to $3,000 cap): $2,500 USDC
Total club credit: $5,000 USDC toward next proposal
```

### Matching Program Rules

- **No self-donations**: Club members cannot donate and claim matching for their own club
- **Verified clubs only**: Only active council member clubs are eligible for matching
- **Manual verification**: All matching is reviewed and approved by CollegeDAO core team
- **Pool availability**: Matching only distributed when the Matching Pool has sufficient funds
- **Quarterly distribution**: Matching credits calculated and announced each quarter

### Club Incentive Tiers

Clubs that consistently source donations receive additional recognition:

| Tier | Annual Donations Sourced | Benefits |
|------|--------------------------|----------|
| **Builder** | $0 - $499 | Leaderboard recognition |
| **Contributor** | $500 - $1,999 | Priority proposal review |
| **Anchor Club** | $2,000+ | Featured club spotlight, priority matching |
